# Myntra-Analysis-Project 
Project Overview:
This project involves conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Myntra dataset to derive meaningful insights about product performance, brand trends, and customer behavior. The analysis focuses on cleaning and preparing the data, identifying key patterns, and creating interactive visualizations to summarize the findings effectively.

Key Objectives:
Analyze brand-wise performance in terms of revenue, ratings, and product counts.
Understand price distribution across various product categories and ratings.
Identify top-performing brands and products based on key metrics such as revenue and ratings.
Steps Undertaken:

Data Cleaning & Preparation:
Removed missing or irrelevant data entries.
Standardized numeric and categorical data for consistency.
Created bins for rating intervals to analyze distributions effectively.

EDA Highlights:
Explored revenue distribution across brands to identify high-performing brands.
Examined price variations between discounted and marked prices for various brands.
Analyzed the distribution of ratings and their correlation with pricing trends.

Dashboard Development:
Designed a dynamic and interactive dashboard in Power BI, featuring:
KPIs like average ratings, total revenue, total products listed, and more.
Bar charts to compare discounted and marked prices by brand.
Rating distributions and their relationship with product prices.
Filters for brand-specific insights.

Key Features of the Dashboard:
Interactive KPIs: Users can select a specific brand and view performance metrics such as revenue, ratings, and product counts.
Visual Insights: Includes bar charts, pie charts, and distribution plots to visualize brand-wise and category-wise performance.
Customizable Analysis: Dynamic filtering allows users to explore top-performing brands or products.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Data Cleaning & Analysis: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Dashboard Development: Power BI for interactive visualization.
